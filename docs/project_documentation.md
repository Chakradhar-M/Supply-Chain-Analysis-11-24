### 📌 Background

The beauty and personal care industry is one of the fastest-growing markets globally, offering products like skincare, haircare, and cosmetics. Behind the scenes, a strong supply chain is critical to keep shelves stocked, fulfill online orders, and meet customer expectations.

In this industry, products are made from ingredients sourced from different suppliers. These materials are then sent to factories where products are manufactured, stored, and later transported to retail stores and warehouses. Many retail stores also serve as delivery hubs for online shoppers.

Managing this entire process, right from sourcing and manufacturing to delivery, requires constant tracking and improvement. If anything goes wrong, like low inventory or delayed shipping, it can impact both customer satisfaction and business profits. That’s why companies use data to understand how their supply chain is performing and to find areas for improvement.

This project focuses on helping a beauty products company analyze and improve its supply chain using Power BI.
